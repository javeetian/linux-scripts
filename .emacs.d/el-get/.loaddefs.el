(autoload 'anything "anything/anything" "\
Main function to execute anything sources.

Keywords supported:
:sources :input :prompt :resume :preselect :buffer :keymap :default :history
Extra keywords are supported and can be added, see below.

When call interactively with no arguments deprecated `anything-sources'
will be used if non--nil.

PLIST is a list like (:key1 val1 :key2 val2 ...) or
\(&optional sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history).

Basic keywords are the following:

:sources

Temporary value of `anything-sources'.  It also accepts a
symbol, interpreted as a variable of an anything source.  It
also accepts an alist representing an anything source, which is
detected by (assq 'name ANY-SOURCES)

:input

Temporary value of `anything-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

:prompt

Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

:resume

If t, Resurrect previously instance of `anything'.  Skip the initialization.
If 'noresume, this instance of `anything' cannot be resumed.

:preselect

Initially selected candidate.  Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.

:buffer

`anything-buffer' instead of *anything*.

:keymap

`anything-map' for current `anything' session.

:default

A default argument that will be inserted in minibuffer with \\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].
When nil of not present `thing-at-point' will be used instead.

:history

By default all minibuffer input is pushed to `minibuffer-history',
if an argument HISTORY is provided, input will be pushed to HISTORY.
History element should be a symbol.

Of course, conventional arguments are supported, the two are same.

\(anything :sources sources :input input :prompt prompt :resume resume
           :preselect preselect :buffer buffer :keymap keymap :default default
           :history history)
\(anything sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap default history)

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this anything session.
The `anything-' prefix can be omitted.  For example,

\(anything :sources 'anything-c-source-buffers
           :buffer \"*buffers*\" :candidate-number-limit 10)

means starting anything session with `anything-c-source-buffers'
source in *buffers* buffer and set variable `anything-candidate-number-limit'
to 10 as session local variable.

information:

* `gist:<id>' : specifies a Gist ID
* `<type>:' : specifies a type of the package source

If `FEATURE in PACKAGE' form is used instead of PACKAGE, then
that FEATURE is `require'd after installing PACKAGE.  You can
also use `el-get-bundle!' macro if FEATURE and PACKAGE are the
same.  If you wish to `require' more than one feature, then use
`:features' property in FORM.

The initialization FORM may start with a property list that
describes a local recipe.  The property list may include the keyword
`:bundle-sync' with a value of either `t' or `nil' to request that
`el-get-bundle' invoke `el-get' synchronously (respectively asynchronously).
The keyword `:bundle-async' is the inverse of `:bundle-sync'.
\(Note that the request to run el-get synchronously may not be respected in all
circumstances: see the definition of `el-get-bundle-el-get' for details.)
The FORM after the property list is treated as initialization code,
which is actually an `:after' property of the local recipe.

       (lambda (result)
         (message \"Async process done, result should be 222: %s\"
                  result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     'ignore)

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to
`async-ready' or `async-wait'.

(autoload 'flycheck-define-error-level "flycheck/flycheck" "\
Define a new error LEVEL with PROPERTIES.

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAP'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level.  See Info node `(elisp)Fringe
     Bitmaps' for more information about fringe bitmaps,
     including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:error-list-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for messages of this
     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.

Define SYMBOL as syntax checker to run a command.

Define SYMBOL as generic syntax checker via
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', which uses an external command
to check the buffer.  SYMBOL and DOCSTRING are the same as for
`flycheck-define-generic-checker'.

In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.

`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.

     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.

     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.
